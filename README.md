**Task:**

Create a web page with a button and an image. Every time the button is pressed a new random image is loaded by consuming [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/) (the _search_ endpoint).

I used it for learning purposes of web development with ASP.NET Core.

> [!NOTE]
> Assign to the **"x-api-key"** header parameter your API key. You can get one for free from [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/#pricing) website.
